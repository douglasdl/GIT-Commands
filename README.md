# GIT
Version control software.

# Github
Web service that uses GIT to host files and handle in a friendly interface.

## Concepts  
Repo: same as Repository.
Repository: a folder that contens the files of a project.  
Readme: document that explains the details of your project.  
Master: main code.  
Branch: creates a copy from the master as a parallel sub version.  
Fork: create a copy from the master to your account to use independently.  
Commit: Save the files.<br>
Push: request to send files request to merge your branch code changes to the master code.  
Pull Request: request the files updates from Github to synchonize your local folder.  
Working Directory:  the files that you are currently working on.  
Working Tree: same as Working Directory.  
Index: same as Staging Area.
Staging Area: intermediary area where commits are prepared.  
History: the versions from your project that can be restored.    
Tracked Files: files included in your project to be monitored.  
Untracked Files: files not included in your project to be monitored.  
Ignored Files: files included in your .gitignore file to be ignored from your project and to not be monitored.  
Tree States (Tracked Files) : Modified, Staged, Committed.

```sh
    git clone user@server:[address]
```


## Create a new Repository
Add a folder from your local folder to Github
```sh
    git init
```

## Create a new Repository (on Server)
Create a new Git Project on Server  
```sh
    git init --bare my-project.git  
```

## Add an existing local repository to an empty repository (on Server)
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin user@server:[address]
git push -u origin master
```

## Copy files from WORK DIRECTORY to STAGE(INDEX)
Add a new file to be sent to Github
```sh
    git add [file]
```

Add ALL the new files, directories or changes to be sent to Github
```sh
    git add .
```

Make interactive inclusions
```sh
    git add -i
```

## Removing Files and Directories to be Commited
Discard the changes in a working directory to be sent to Github
```sh
    git restore [file]
```
    
Discard the changes in a working directory to be sent to Github
```sh
    git rm --cached [file]
```

## Removing Untracked Files and Directories from workspace
Dry run to see which files youâ€™ll delete
```sh
    git clean -n -d
```

Delete all untracked files and direcories
```sh
    git clean -f -d
```
  
Cancel changes from working area file
```sh

```

Create a new branch and switch to it
```sh
    git switch -c [branchname]
```


# Merge Branches
